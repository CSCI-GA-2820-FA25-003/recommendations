This repository implements a **Recommendations Microservice** built with Flask and SQLAlchemy.  
It follows the NYU DevOps microservice architecture template and supports RESTful endpoints for managing product recommendations.

---

## Overview

This project provides a backend service for managing product-to-product recommendations, such as **cross-sell**, **up-sell**, or **accessory** suggestions.  
It includes a data model, Flask API routes, test cases, and Docker/Makefile workflows for development and deployment.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/CSCI-GA-2820-FA25-003/recommendations
cd recommendations

# Use Python 3.11 with Pipenv
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell

# Copy environment variables
cp dot-env-example .env

# Run service

- [ ] Add `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints in the Flask app
- [ ] Add `Location` header in POST response dynamically
- [ ] Improve factory seeding for integration testing
- [ ] CI pipeline with GitHub Actions
